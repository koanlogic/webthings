Troubleshooting
===============

(*) installing on motes yields Protocol Errors. 

There is known bug in cp210x USB driver support on 2.6 kernel, which causes the
device to timeout too quickly.

#  apt-get install build-essential linux-source

Patch file drivers/usb/serial/cp210x.c by increasing all occurrences of
timeout from 300 to 3000, then 

# modprobe -r cp210x
