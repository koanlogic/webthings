The objective of this module is to provide a simplified framework and
documentation for building Wireless Sensor Networks, using CoAP [1] as a
HTTP-like REST-ful interface for interacting with sensor nodes, based on the
most common open source mote OS-level environments, namely Contiki [2] and
TinyOS [3].

The external communication, and hence the information gathered by sensors, is
then made accessible to outer networks via KINK's CoAP/HTTP proxy, as shown in
following basic architectural diagram:

                  |       KINK        |             WSN
                  |                   |     
    standard      |                   |       mote1     /\ moteN
    network       |         ___       |         /\ ---- \/
       /     <=> HTTP <=>  /   \ <=> CoAP <=>   \/  /\   ..
    Internet      |        \___/      |             \/   
                  |        proxy      |            mote2

In the future, the framework should support the largest possible number of
target mote types, but this kind of horizontal scalability will depend on OS
support. 

The current reference hardware platform is Zolertia Z1 [4] (MSP430 F2617 CPU,
CC2420 transceiver). CoAP support for this mote on TinyOS is currently
lacking due to space constrains, so for now [README.TinyOS] contains only
information on how to get plain applications running on motes. So please refer
to [README.Contiki] to get experimental CoAP-based applications up and running.

The READMEs have been tested on:
    - VM host: Mac OS X 10.5 and 10.7
    - OS: Linux Debian 6.0.3

[README.trouble] contains some troubleshooting tips.
