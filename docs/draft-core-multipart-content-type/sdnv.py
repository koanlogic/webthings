# sdnv_decode() takes a string argument (s), which is assumed to be
#   an SDNV, and optionally a number (slen) for the maximum number of
#   bytes to parse from the string.  The function returns a pair of
#   the non-negative integer n that is the numeric value encoded in
#   the SDNV, and integer that is the distance parsed into the input
#   string.  If the slen argument is not given (or is not a non-zero
#   number) then, s is parsed up to the first byte whose high-order
#   bit is 0 -- the length of the SDNV portion of s does not have to
#   be pre-computed by calling code.  If the slen argument is given
#   as a non-zero value, then slen bytes of s are parsed.  The value
#   for n of -1 is returned for any type of parsing error.
#
# NOTE: In python, integers can be of arbitrary size.  In other
#   languages, such as C, SDNV-parsing routines should take
#   precautions to avoid overflow (e.g., by using the Gnu MP library,
#   or similar).
