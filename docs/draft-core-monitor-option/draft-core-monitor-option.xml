    <abstract>
      <t>This memo defines two additional options for the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP): Monitor and Update.</t> 
      
      <t>The first enables monitoring of a node sleeping most of the time without requiring the client pulling all the time.</t>

      <t>The latter enables opportunistic updates, driven by sleepy nodes, which actually MAY never need to listen.</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

    <section title="Introduction">

      <t>The proposal described in this memo covers the following use case: a node N, which is sleeping most of the time, depends one or more resources hosted at another sleepy node M. In cases as such, the probability of an empty intersection between their respective wake periods is very high, making it hard for the two to synchronize.</t>

      <t>In this scenario, using the basic proxy functionality is not enough. In fact, if a cached resource at M becomes stale while M is sleeping, request from N could result in a 5.04 (Gateway Timeout) response code. Further, the basic observe pattern could lead to lost state updates in case N is offline while M pushes its notifications.</t>

      <t>This memo introduces two extensions to the Proxy caching functionality that give the Proxy the ability to keep the freshest copy of a resource while its origin and clients may be offline. Conversely, clients and origins are provided the ability to both read and write the resource copy while the other party may be offline.</t>

      <section title="Requirements Language">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>

      <section title="Monitor Option">
        <t>The Monitor option is used to ask a Proxy to keep a given resource fresh by continuously observing (polling, at worst) it, while the requesting node is sleeping. Thus the sleepy sensor can get the latest representation published by the monitored resource when it wakes up, even if the origin is sleeping.</t>
  
        <t>The Monitor option is critical. If the Proxy does not recognize it, a 4.02 (Bad Option) MUST be returned to the client.</t>
	
	<t>The Monitor option has a meaning on the request only.</t>

          </figure>
          <t>The client PUT's the resource to be monitored, identified by the Proxy-URI. The request message contains a Monitor option, and possibly specifies a TTL (i.e. an implicit de-registration indication) for the monitor through Max-Age. One or more content types for the acceptable representations of the resource are optionally specified via the Accept option.</t>
  
          <t>The operation creates a monitor resource at the Proxy, that MUST be a carbon copy of one or more representations of the monitored resource.</t>
	  
	  <t>Upon a successfull request the client MUST be returned a 2.01 response and one Etag. The Etag SHALL be unique per object.</t>
	  
	  <t>The Location-Path option MAY be used to indicate to the client where he SHALL find the latest version of the content. In case of absense of a Location-Path option the client SHALL use the location pointed by the Proxy-URI of the original request.</t>
  
	  <t>The Etag option value is stored and SHALL be used by the client to perform monitor de-registration.</t>
  
          <t>There may be multiple clients requesting a monitor on a same resource, with the same content-type, and those are coalesced into the same object.</t>
	  
	  <t>Different data representations, namely different content-type, are dealt by the proxy as different resources, but the proxy MAY even coalesce requests to the same resource with different content-types, provided it is able to perform application data conversion.</t>
	  
	  <t>For a given coalesced object a references list, containing Etags and (updated) Max-Ages, is kept.</t>

        <section title="Monitor De-registration">
          <t>The monitor MUST be actually deleted at the Proxy when its associated references list is empty.</t>

        <section title="Resource Refresh">
          <t>In order to minimize the number of messages used by the monitoring process, the Proxy SHOULD try to install an observation on the requested resource first. In case this attempt fails, the Proxy will fall back to repeated poll possibly driven by the Max-Age value indicated by the origin server. Usual cache validation MUST be applied to the cached copy of the monitored resource (CHECK THIS).</t>
