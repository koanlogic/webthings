    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>This memo defines the Publish Option for the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP).</t>
      <t>The Publish Option is used by a sleepy end-point (SEP) to temporarily delegate the authority of one of its resources to another, always on, node which is typically a proxy but doesn't need to be necessarily.</t>
      <t>The SEP is given a simple RESTful messaging protocol that enables the setup, renewal and cancellation of the authority transfer.  The whole process is driven by the SEP, which may actually never need to listen or to keep any state.</t>
      <t>This memo also introduces the 'proxies' Web Linking relation type.  This new relation -- complementing the default 'hosts' relation -- can be used by a CoAP proxy to explicitly advertise the resources that it can serve either from cache or by forwarding the client request upstream.</t>
      <t>The 'proxies' relation works in concert with the Publish Option to enable SEP discovery even while SEP is off-line.</t>
      <section title="Requirements Language and Motivation">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>
        <t>This memo reuses the terminology introduced in <xref target="I-D.rahman-core-sleepy-problem-statement"/>, and aims at meeting the objectives stated in its Section 4 via an entirely in-protocol solution.</t>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section title="Publish Option">
      <t>The Publish Option enables a SEP to temporarily (i.e. for a specified "lease" time) delegate the authority of one of its hosted resources to a Proxy node that will start to behave as the origin for the Publish'ed resource.  This allows a SEP to use the Proxy as the rendezvous point for one-way SEP to SEP signaling.</t>

      <section title="Publishing a Resource">
        <t>The origin server publishes one of its hosted resources, specified by the enclosed Proxy-URI, by PUT'ing it to the Proxy with a Publish Option attached.  The Publish Option value specifies the CoAP methods that clients are allowed to use on the resource (see <xref target="publish_format"/>).</t>
        <t>The example in <xref target="publish_creation"/> shows a delegation where the GET and PUT methods are allowed while POST and DELETE are explicitly prohibited, meaning that the resource can be read and updated by clients, but it can't be deleted nor created.</t>
        <figure align="left" anchor="publish_creation">
          <artwork align="left"><![CDATA[

+-------->|

          ]]></artwork>
        </figure>
        <t>The Proxy, which is voluntarily charged by the resource owner to act as the delegated origin for the "lease" time specified by Max-Age, replies with a 2.01 if the authority transfer succeeds.  An exact duplicate of the submitted representation is created, and from now on it can be accessed using the original URI provided that clients request it through the delegated Proxy.  If the Publish operation does not succeed (e.g. because the Proxy does not support Publish), then the origin transfer fails, and an appropriate response code is returned (e.g. 4.02 Bad Option).</t>
        <t>An ETag MAY be supplied as a metadata to be included in responses involving the Publish'ed representation.  If no Max-Age is given, a default of 3600 seconds MUST be assumed.  The Max-Age value, either implicit or explicit, determines the lifetime of the origin delegation.  When Max-Age is elapsed, the Proxy MUST delete the Publish'ed resource value and fall back to its usual proxying function.</t>
        <t>The Publish Option is critical and MUST be present in the request only. If the Proxy does not recognize it, a 4.02 (Bad Option) MUST be returned to the client.  If the Option value is not correctly formatted (see <xref target="publish_format"/>), a 4.00 (Bad Request) MUST be returned to the client.  The Publish Option is not Safe-to-Forward, and neither is a Cache-Key.</t>
        <t>Since the 2.01 is emitted, and for the duration of the delegation, any client wishing to access the resource can do so by making a Proxy-URI request to the Proxy node, which shall then serve the resource off from its own storage.</t>
        <t>The Proxy MUST save the identity of the resource Publish'er and MUST use it to distinguish "maintainance" operations such as update or explicit deletion, from "regular" access to the published resource by third parties.</t>
        <t>An interesting outcome of this communication strategy is that the SEP may really never need to listen on its radio interface.  However, ignoring the response status code from Proxy is not a safe practice and is not encouraged.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Updating a Resource">
        <t>In order to update the delegated resource state, the SEP shall send the very same request (except possibly the representation value) to the Proxy, which in turn replies with a 2.04 Changed status code in case the update operation succeeds.  If the operation fails, e.g. because the request comes from an end-point different from the Publish'ing SEP, a suitable status code is returned (e.g. 4.01 Unauthorized).</t>

        <section title="Publishing the /.well-known/core Resource" anchor="wkc">

          <t>The Link-Format specification <xref target="RFC6690" /> has no explicit text about discovery of "well-known" devices through a Proxy, or about the cacheability rules for such resource.  Even if it seems reasonable to assume that the /.well-known/core URI is both query-able and cacheable through a Proxy, on the contrary the situation is not very much so.</t>  
          <t>In fact, since the "well-known" interface relies on the resource origin being implicitly defined by the source address of the UDP packet carrying the response, quering the "well-known" interface (either unicast or multicast) through a Proxy-URI has little hope to be fully functional.  The (ab)use of a an implicit L3 locator as the identifier of the resource authority makes "well-known" discovery generally incompatible with Proxy mediated communication, unless each target URI in a link is given as a URI and not as a relative-ref (section 4.1 of <xref target="RFC3986" />).</t>

          <t>Consequently, in this proposal we assume that the /.well-known/core of a SEP can be Publish'ed if and only if the target URI in the each link is not a relative-ref.</t>
 
          <t>Its registration is the same as in <xref target="publish_creation" />, but the Proxy MAY need to treat it in a way that is slightly different from other "normal" delegated resources.  In fact, while delegation is in place (i.e. the lease period is not elapsed, and neither explicit revocation has happened) the Proxy MAY be able to respond to filtered queries (section 4.1 of <xref target="RFC6690" />) regarding the Publish'ed /.well-known/core.</t>

       <section title="Resource Directory">
        <t>Given the strong requirement on the link formatting given in <xref target="wkc" />, it could be preferable (or even necessary) to use the Resource Directory <xref target="I-D.ietf-core-resource-directory" /> as a means of delegating the discovery of the resources hosted at a SEP.</t>

        <t>This can be done either by the SEP, or automatically by the delegated Proxy when a Publish request is received.</t>
