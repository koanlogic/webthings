      <t>This memo describes the use of EUI-64 and Resource Directory names in CoAP Certificate Mode DTLS for the purpose of verifying the identity of a server by a client endpoint.</t>

    <section title="Terminology and Requirements Language">
      <t>This specification requires the reader to be familiar with the terminology used in documents produced by the CoRE, TLS, and PKIX working groups.</t>

      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119" />.</t>
    </section>  <!-- Terminology and Requirements Language -->

    <section title="Motivation and Scope">
      <t>The CoAP protocol <xref target="I-D.ietf-core-coap" /> defines a so called "Certificate Mode" for DTLS to dereference URIs using the 'coaps' scheme.  In this mode, a X.509 certificate <xref target="RFC5280" /> is used to authenticate a server endpoint to the requesting party.  The selection of the server certificate to be presented is determined by the URI authority of the requested resource, which is hinted by the client by means of the Server Name Indication (SNI) extension <xref target="RFC6066" /> during the DTLS handshake with the server.</t>

      <t>According to Section 9.1.3.3 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-core-coap" />, a client, when presented with a certificate carrying the identity of the server in the SubjectAltName (SAN), must check that the authority of the requested URI matches at least one of the authority names of any CoAP URI found in a field of URI type in the SAN set.</t>

      <t>According to Section 4.2.1.6 of <xref target="RFC5280" /> an URI that includes an authority - such as a 'coaps' URI - needs to include a fully qualified domain name (FQDN), or an IP literal as its host part.</t>

      <t>The combination of the two requirements above, together with text in Section 3 of <xref target="RFC6066" /> which only allows FQDN hostname of the server in the ServerName field, basically binds Certificate Mode DTLS to either DNS, or static host tables containing FQDN's mappings, or some other system for lookup of registered names which is able to fully mimic the DNS naming scheme.</t>

      <t>Because DNS is not mandatory to implement in CoAP networks, and static configuration is not generally a viable option, there is a need to define some kind of stable, non-DNS, identifier that can be used for 'coaps' URIs in Certificate Mode DTLS as a fall-back in case DNS is not deployed, or not understood by CoAP endpoints.</t>

      <t>The purpose of this memo is to describe syntax and rules for using Resource Directory endpoint names (and domains) <xref target="I-D.ietf-core-resource-directory" /> or EUI-64 identifiers <xref target="EUI-64" /> as an alternative to DNS names in the above said context.</t>

      <t>This memo contains updates to <xref target="I-D.ietf-core-coap" />, <xref target="RFC6066" />, and <xref target="RFC5280" />.</t>
    </section>  <!-- Motivation -->

    <section title="Proposal to Ban Common Name for Endpoint Identification">
      <t>This section contains a proposal to amend text in Section 9.1.3.3 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-core-coap" /> to disallow Common Name (CN) to be used as a fall back identifier in case SAN is not present in the certificate of the server.  In fact, <xref target="RFC2818" /> already deprecated the use of CN in this same scenario, and encouraged the use of the dNSName field in SAN instead.</t>
    <t>The intention is to achieve a reduction in complexity in both spec and code that comes from defining one only path for identity lookup.  Since there are virtually no legacy deployments, we are in the ideal position to place an explicit requirement on clients to request proper certificates to their Certification Authority (CA).</t>
      <t>Proposed text: "Implementations in Certificate Mode MUST verify the identity of their peers by looking at the Subject Alternative Name's set found in the presented certificate.  Common Name's MUST NOT be used to verify peers' identities."</t>

        <t>No character needs to be percent encoded, thus percent encoding MUST NOT be used when encoding a eui-64-authority.</t>


        <t>
          Notes:
          <list style="format %d">
            <t>eui-64 is a subset of unreserved (<xref target="RFC3986" />) chars.  As such it encodes a strict subset of reg-name, which fits smoothly in the host part of a 'coaps' URI.</t>
            <t>A more space efficient encoding could have been used, e.g. (a) removing the "-" separator, or (b) using a wider base, e.g. base-64 with URL safe alphabet <xref target="RFC4648" />.  The present encoding has been preferred over (a) as it is immune from collisions with IPv4 addresses in plain numeric notation.  For example, provided an OUI-24 of 92-23-37 exist, then 9223372038985482241, which is a completely plausible EUI-64 identifier, could be associated to IPv4 127.0.0.1 if interpreted as a 64-bit integer truncated to 32-bits.  The present encoding has been preferred over option (b) because that would require the host part of the URI to be case sensitive, thus contradicting <xref target="RFC3986" />.</t>

      <section title="Uri-Host and Uri-Port Considerations" anchor="Implicit-Option-Values">
        <t>When eui-64-authority is used in a 'coaps' URI, its value is the same as the ServerName.name included (and successfully validated) by the client in the associated DTLS handhshake (see <xref target="EUI-64-SNI" />).</t>
        <t>Hence, there is no need to include explicit Uri-Host and Uri-Port Options in requests associated to the same security context <cref>This updates Sections 6.4 and 6.5 of [I-D.ietf-core-coap]</cref>.</t>
