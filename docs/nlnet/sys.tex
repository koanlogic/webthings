\href{https://github.com/koanlogic/webthings/tree/master/sys}{\swmod{sys}} is an early stage component which will include firmware generation procedures and documentation targeted at both the involved platforms:
\begin{itemize}
\item sys/kink: an \href{http://openwrt.org}{OpenWrt}-based firmware generation system for the target hardware (currently Ubiquiti Routerstation Pro) and possible kernel patches;
\item sys/wsn: a set of scripts and HowTos which aid in setting up a constrained network based on the target sensor nodes (currently Zolertia Z1 platform). \href{http://www.tinyos.net}{TinyOS} and \href{http://www.contiki-os.org}{Contiki} are the two OS-level candidates for the base system. At this stage both of them are being followed since CoAP support is still at an early stage on both of them. Custom extensions/patches may be required. TinyOS and Contiki also include simulation tools which will be explored for massive testing purposes.
\end{itemize}
