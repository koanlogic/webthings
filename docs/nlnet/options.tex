The \href{https://github.com/koanlogic/webthings/blob/master/docs/draft-core-monitor-option/}{draft-fossati-core-monitor-option} I-D introduces a couple of new CoAP Options that can be harnessed by ``sleepy'' sensors to force the Proxy to act as a blackboard/bin object where they can publish/retrieve resources needed for their operation, during their typically very short duty cycles.  This is a convenient feature which we are going to present at \mbox{IETF 83}, and implement in the KINK Proxy.
