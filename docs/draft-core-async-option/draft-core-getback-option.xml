    <abstract>

      <t>This memo defines a framework for allowing asynchronous communication between sleepy sensors which is mediated by a supporting Proxy node.</t>

      <t>The Proxy acts as a store-and-forward agent that handles requests on behalf of a sleepy client, and buffers responses coming from the target origin until the requesting client wakes up and get the computation results.</t>

      <t>Two new CoAP options are defined to control the asynchronous exchange: GetBack and Sleepy.</t>

    </abstract>
  </front>

  <middle>
    <section title="Introduction">

      <t>The proposal described in this memo covers the following use case: a node A, displaying a very short duty-cycle, needs to interact with one or more resources hosted at another sleepy node B.
      <!-- that has a longer duty-cycle than A -->
      The probability of an empty intersection between their respective wake periods is quite high, making it hard for the two to synchronize.</t>

      <t>We want to arm the Proxy with the ability to act as a store-and-forward agent mediating the request/response exchange between A and B.  A declares the will to act onto a given resource hosted at B to the Proxy, and gives a "getback" indication that tells the Proxy the time at which it is going to be on duty again, and willing to retrieve the response from B.  The proxy is in charge of making the request on behalf of A, using an appropriate poll interval for a time span upper bounded by the "getback" value, and to buffer the potential response from B until A wakes up again.</t>

      <section title="Requirements Language">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119" />.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Basic Message Flow">
      <t>A typical flow of communication involving the said options is shown in <xref target="base_msg_flow" />.  Please note that the framework is completely agnostic as to the transported COAP message type and method.</t>

      <t>In message (1) a sleepy node, A, asks the Proxy to act upon the resource identified by the Proxy-Uri Option in a possibly asynchronous way by supplying the GetBack Option indicating a time at which A thinks it will be ready (i.e. awake) to retrieve the response message.</t> 

      <t>In case the Proxy understands the GetBack Option, it replies (2) with a [TBD] status code </t>
      
      <t> A ticket associated to the asynchronous transaction is not needed.</t>

      <t>From now on A can get back to sleep while the Proxy sends the request to the target node, B -- messages (3-5) and eventually get a response back (6).</t>

      <t>The stored response is kept by the Proxy until A is on duty again.  A reissues the original request and gets the corresponding response (8).</t>

      <!-- TODO reposition this -->
      <t>An interesting feature here is that in case a CON exchange is requested by A, a separate ACK coming from B can be coalesced by the Proxy in a single piggybacked response to A.  Further, the Proxy may rearrange any implied block-wise transfer <xref target="I-D.ietf-core-block" /> in an optimal way.</t>

The latter exchange SHALL be armed with a very short timeout to be as friendly as possible to the short duty cycle of the requesting node.</t>

To save bandwith, a node with the intention of advertising its duty cycle, SHOULD include the Sleepy option only in its first message exchange with each requesting agent. The node MAY include the Sleepy option in later responses in case its duty cycle is subjected to changes. </t>
