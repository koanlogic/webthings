client
- add .ictrl to handle RST and separated ACK cleanly

server
- garbage collect lingering server contexts:
    - add a .last_used timestamp to the ec_server_t 
    - add timer + garbage collector function to ec_servers_t
- remove .ictrl since it is unused

resources
- add dynamic well-known builder interface to ec_filesys_t
- add link-format resource attributes to ec_res_t
- add "owner/creator Id" to support the Publish option

observe
- should it be completely merged into the ec_server_t logics/lifetime ?  this
  would avoid special case'ing the RST handling in ec_server_handle_pdu()
- hook caching of produced representations (so that the representation producer
  callback can be called only when it is really needed)
