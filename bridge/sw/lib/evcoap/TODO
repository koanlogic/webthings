client
- add .ictrl to handle RST and separated ACK cleanly

server
- garbage collect lingering server contexts:
    - add a .last_used timestamp to the ec_server_t 
    - add timer + garbage collector function to ec_servers_t

resources
- add "owner/creator Id" to support the Publish option

observe
- should it be completely merged into the ec_server_t logics/lifetime ?  this
  would avoid special case'ing the RST handling in ec_server_handle_pdu()
- hook caching of produced representations (so that the representation producer
  callback can be called only when it is really needed)
- add hook to the underlying resource in observe

misc
- check in evcoap/evcoap_opt whenever we downcast (e.g. from ec_mt_t to u16)
  that the result argument is initialized to a value that is compatible with 
  the target type

POST PLUGTESTS ideas and fixes
==============================

- make vhosting optional: if disabled dispatch by resource path
    - related to this, take care of uri-host normalization (use binary repr cmp?)
- do a generic options iterator (e.g. opt_iter(opts_t *opts, worker(opts_t *)))
- client: reuse context to avoid src port changes (Block, Observe)
- server: basic FSM for non-safe operations
- check: block size negotiation
